# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for incomplete or invalid data in POST requests.  The provided `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version with robust error handling. 

## Problem

The original code lacks validation and error handling for incoming user data. If the client sends an incomplete or malformed request body, the server may crash or behave unexpectedly, without providing informative error messages to the client. 

## Solution

The solution introduces proper validation using a schema and appropriate error handling mechanisms. This ensures that the application gracefully handles invalid inputs, providing clear and helpful feedback to the client.
